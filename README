  comming soon...


- Requirements

    This software runs on 
     - Firefox.
     - Python for Unix (Mac, Linux, or cygwin version)
       Python for Win32, ActivePython, etc... are not well.
       because this software depends on many posix functions 
       'os.fork', 'os.openpty' ..etc.
     - Posix enviroinment. 
       If you are running Windows, you need to install cygwin at C:\cygwin.

    Probably, it requires Firefox version 4.0+ and Python 2.5+.

- Installing as Vimperator plugin:

    [Mac, Linux]
    
        Makes symbolic link of modules/corun.js into Vimperator's 
        plugin directory as following:
    
          > ln -s $PWD/modules/corun.js $RUNTIME/plugin/ 
        
        $RUNTIME is Vimperator's runtime directory such as 
        '$HOME/.vimperator'.
    
    [Windows]
    
        Comming soon.
