= coTerminal User Manual

== Introduction: What is it?
    "coTerminal" is a Firefox browser extension that shows a terminal emurator 
    interface and enables you to access flexible, powerful functionality 
    provided by your operating system, such as commandline shells, curses-based 
    applications.

== Overview hilighting features
    - Full Gecko based user interface, it is flexible and easy to customize.
    - Multi-platform, now supports Mac / Linux / Windows + Cygwin (requires posix python).
    - Supports plugin architecture. it supports Plug-and-Play installing & uninstalling.
      (documents for developing is comming soon... - -;)
    - Including debugger, you can run it in step-execution-mode or trace-mode 
      and observe terminal I/O sequence in real-time. (it's interesting!)
    - IME is supported.
    - Supports east asian double width characters.
    - Localization supported. localize resource can be edited on bottom-panel UI.
    - Selects variable character encoding supported by Gecko.
    - Supports transparent window. it is useful when www-browseing while working at terminal.
    - Retaining TTY session duaring restarting browser.
      (Now, this feature is not works well in Cygwin version. 
      Frontend UI that makes you to select/edit session, ...such as screen/tmux, 
      is not implemented yet. - -;)
    - xterm-like mouse emuration, and supports smoothing pixel scroll.
    - Text selection / Rectangle text selection
    - Supports copy / paste in Drag & Drop or keyboard shortcut.
    - Supports move / resize through Drag & Drop operation.
    - Supports 256 terminal color, you can assign 32bit colors for them.
    - Vimperator / Keysnail like commandline interface.
    - Running as independent XUL application if you want. (but now buggy!)
    - Patching w3m, it supports inline image (now buggy! on MacOSX only... - -;).

== Requirements
    - Firefox 4.0+.
    - Python for Unix (Probably 2.5+, Mac, Linux, or cygwin version)
      Python for Win32, ActivePython, etc... are not well.
      because this software depends on many posix functions 
      'os.fork', 'os.openpty' ..etc.
    - Posix enviroinment. 
      If you are running Windows, you need to install cygwin at C:\cygwin.

== Installing and Running

=== Building Firefox extension:
.Mac, Linux, Cygwin
----
./configure
make
----
    If build process was succeeded, target XPI file 
    "coterminal@zuse.jp.xpi" is to be generated. enjoy it!
    
=== Installing as Vimperator plugin:

.Mac, Linux
    Makes symbolic link of modules/corun.js into Vimperator's 
    plugin directory as following:
----
  > ln -s $PWD/modules/corun.js $RUNTIME/plugin/ 
----
    $RUNTIME is Vimperator's runtime directory such as 
    '$HOME/.vimperator'.
        
=== Run as XUL Application (test version, it does not works well...):
    
.MacOSX
----
open /Applications/Firefox.app --args --app $(PWD)/application.ini
----
.Linux
----
firefox --app application.ini
----
.Cygwin on Windows
----
cygstart firefox.exe --app application.ini
----

== Usage
=== Launch terminal
    If you succeeded to install, you can create new terminal window 
    by selecting application menu: [Tool] -> [create new terminal].
    The keyboad shortcut "control-," has the same effect.
