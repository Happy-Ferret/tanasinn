/**
 * @class SendReceiveMode
 *
 * SRM â€” Local Echo: Send/Receive Mode
 *
 * This control function turns local echo on or off. When local echo is on,
 * the terminal sends keyboard characters to the screen. The host does not 
 * have to send (echo) the characters back to the terminal display. When 
 * local echo is off, the terminal only sends characters to the host. It is 
 * up to the host to echo characters back to the screen.
 *
 * Default: No local echo
 *
 * Format
 *
 * CSI    1    2    h
 * 9/11   3/1  3/2  6/8
 *
 * Set: local echo off.
 * 
 *
 * CSI    1    2    l
 * 9/11   3/1  3/2  6/12
 *
 * Reset: local echo on.
 *
 * Description
 *
 * When the SRM function is set, the terminal sends keyboard characters to
 * the host only. The host can echo the characters back to the screen.
 *
 * When the SRM function is reset, the terminal sends keyboard characters to
 * the host and to the screen. The host does have to echo characters back to
 * the terminal.
